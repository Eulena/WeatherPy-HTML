# WeatherPy-HTML-CSS

The goal of this homework was to build a website that will demonstrate a visualization dashboard for a previous homework on "WeatherPy" (04/10/2019) using HTML and CSS. To create this dashboard, I started retrieving all the images of scatter plot from previous homework, folder created to hold all these images of Latitude vs. Temparature, Latitude vs. Cloudiness, Latitude vs. Humidity, and Latitude vs. Wind Speed. Four HTML pages were created accordingly for each scatter plot, this is to show users the comparison as they navigate between them.  Then, siginificantly, I created a CSS file to format the content and style of the website. In my CSS file font, size, color, spacing, border and location of HTML information were all difined to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to the website and throughout multiple pages of the website.

# The Website 

## Landing Page
Contains an explanation of the weatherPy project and links to each visualization page.
## Four Visualization Pages: 
Contains a descriptive title, plot/visualization itself, and a brief description of the plot and its significance.
## Comparison Page: 
Contains all the visualization on the same page so users can easily visually compare the four plots.
## Data Page: 
Contains a responsive table with data used for the visualizations.
```
