# WeatherPy-HTML-CSS

The goal of this homework was to build a website that will demonstrate a visualization dashboard for a previous homework on "WeatherPy" (04/19/2019) using HTML and CSS. To create this dashboard, I started retrieving all the images of scatter plot from previous homework, folder created to hold all these images of Latitude vs. Temparature, Latitude vs. Cloudiness, Latitude vs. Humidity, and Latitude vs. Wind Speed. Four HTML pages were created accordingly for each scatter plot, this is to show users the comparison as they navigate between them. At the same time an HTML was also created for the data that holds more than 500 records. Then, siginificantly, I created a CSS file to format the content and style of the website. In my CSS file, font, size, color, spacing, border and location of HTML information were all difined to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes all throughout multiple pages of the website.
